> Instantly spot Years of Experience and Degree requirements on LinkedIn job posts.

## What is QuickSpot?

I built **QuickSpot** because I was tired of wasting time opening long job descriptions 
only to find out I didnâ€™t meet the Years of Experience or Degree requirements.

**QuickSpot** automatically detects and highlights:
- **YoE (Years of Experience)** requirements
- **Degree** qualifications (Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, etc.)

It displays them at the top of every LinkedIn job page in clean, colorful badges
so you know instantly whether a role matches you.

3. Visit **chrome://extensions/**
4. Enable **Developer Mode** (top-right toggle).
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `quickspot/` folder.
6. Done! ðŸŽ‰

Now open any job on [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) â€”  
QuickSpot will automatically detect and display the key requirements.
